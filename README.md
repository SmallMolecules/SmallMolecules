# Installation Guide and Information

## About this Framework

This framework creates a many body particle physics simulator in C#, implemented in Unity, for educational purporses. The 3D environment will be incorperated into virtual reality to enhance the educational experience and provide interactivity. 

The framework is designed to enable further expansion by developers and teachers.

To view the documentation for this framework, first follow the guide to install the framework, and open the file ``index.html`` located in the ``html/`` folder in any web-browser. The main page has a guide for developers.

## Installing Unity

To install this framework, first you need to install unity on your system. To do that, navigate to Unity's [Downloads Page](https://unity.com/download) and install Unity Hub. After downloading and intsallting, create a Unity account or sign in with an existing one. From the unity hub you can download version 2020.3.16 or locate an existing install. It's from here that you can manage your installs of Unity and your projects.

## Installing the Framework

To install the framework, first navigate to our github page 

> [Small Molecules github page](https://github.com/SmallMolecules/small-molecules)

and run the following git command where you want the project folder to spawn. If you do not have git installed on your system, you can download it from [the git downloads page](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Next clone the repository onto your system by opening a terminal at that location and typing the following git command:

> git clone github.c[]()om/SmallMolecules

This will create a directory called *Small Molecules* which contains all the unity project files. You have now installed the framework.

## Running the Simulator

To run the simulator, simply add the folder *small-molecules/Particle Simulator* as a project, ensuring you have the correct version of Unity installed. Then load up the folder ``Assets/Scenes`` and load the scene called *Main Scene*. To run, click on the play icon. 

For further instruction on how to use the simulator as a user, consult ``user guide.pdf``.
